# Teacher Workshop

## About

In this workshop you will:

- Be introduced to Computer Science & Computational Thinking
- Particpate in hands-on Robotics, Coding and STEM activities
- Learn how to teach Computer Science concepts without a computer

If you would like to use any of the materials in your classroom or modify them in anyway, you are welcome to do so - provided you acknowledge the original source(s).
I have included links to extra resources on the [Resources]( {{ site.baseurl }}/resources ) page and on each of the different session pages.

I work with other researchers at the University of Newcastle, running 2 day Professional Development workshops for Primary and High School teachers.
There is more information about these workshops [here](http://www.newcastle.edu.au/cs4s){:target="_blank"}. 
The High School workshop's registration page is [here](https://goo.gl/forms/LHSSdZqhcc){:target="_blank"}. 
The registration for the Primary School workshop hasn't opened yet but if you are interested in attending, please let me know and I will send you a reminder email once the registration opens.
