# Writing Algorithms with Edison Robots

## About

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
You could say that whenever you cook a meal, you are performing an algorithm (by following a recipe).

When Computer Scientists and Software Engineers write code, they must write algorithms to instruct a computer how to perform a task.
Writing algorithms is an essential part of Computer Science and Coding, as computers only understand precise and explicit instructions.
Algorithms make everything you do with digital technologies possible - whether it's checking your emails, finding someone's house with a GPS or finding something with Google.

In this session we will write some algorithms for solving navigation problems with Edison robots.
The Edison robots used today have been provided by UON's [AIM HIGH](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/community-and-alumni/community-engagement/community-and-school-programs/aim-high) program.
