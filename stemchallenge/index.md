# STEM Challenge

## About

**STEM** is an acronym for **S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering and **M**athematics. 
STEM is a large and diverse collection of fields, you can see a list of STEM degrees [here](http://stemdegreelist.com/stem-degree-list/){:target="_blank"}.

There is [increasing focus](https://www.studentsfirst.gov.au/restoring-focus-stem-schools-initiative){:target="_blank"} on STEM in K - 12 in Australia. 
It is argued that students will need STEM skills to be prepared for their future careers. 
These skills can also help students understand the natural and digital world, and help develop their critical and analytical thinking.

Some educators see Art and Design as essential to innovation, and so they use the acronym [STEAM](http://stemtosteam.org/){:target="_blank"} (**S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **A**rt and **M**athematics) instead.
